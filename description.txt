<!--
The goal today is to get a few routes working by fetching data from DB.
You are to 
1. Download the JSON file from course material. Create a new DB from Compass, create a new collection in this new DB, import the JSON file to this new collection
2. Create a new directory and create a node project out of it , saying npm init inside that new folder
3. Your app needs to talk to MongoDB using Mongoose. So , install mongoose and express saying 'npm i mongoose', 'npm i express' at cmd prompt for the project.
4. Download server.js and songSchema.js in to your project folder
5. server.js code is partially written for you, you need to modify the code where it says **
6. Modify the code such that the following routes work --
    / returns message "Reached BackEnd Server"
    /artists returns array of distinct artists
    /artists/bryanadams returns an array of BryanAdams' songs without _id
    /artists/BillieEilish returns an array of BilliEilish's songs without _id 
    /band/beatles returns an array of songs by beatles without _id
    /artists/billyjoel returns 'no songs found'
7. Make sure the url you type below has the ipaddress and does not have '/' at the end
-->
<config>
<url value=""></url>
</config>
